Features to add:
- Collision with self = game over
- As score increases, add new food/fruit of different colors and different properties (e.g., make snake even longer, make snake smaller but keep score, change speed up and down)

Bugs:
- Edge of screen detected prematurely (or render speed of the indexed snake head =/= the speed the user sees), sometimes prompted early game over
